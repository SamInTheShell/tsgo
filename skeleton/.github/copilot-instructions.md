# Copilot Instructions

Whenever adding new code or modifying existing code, please update these instructions accordingly.
This document provides information to help Copilot understand the structure and standards of the project.

## Project Details
TODO: This needs to be defined by the user (leave this as-is during setup).

## Frontend
The frontend uses React, TypeScript, Material UI, and Lucide.

You can use both lucid and material ui icons, just consider what fits best for the context.

When working on the frontend, please ensure that you:
- Check the available packages in the `package.json` file.
- Use packages that are already included in the project.
- Avoid adding new packages unless absolutely necessary.

New pages are stored in `frontend/src/components/pages/`.
See `frontend/src/components/pages/404.tsx` for an example of a page component.

All other components are typically stored in `frontend/src/components/layout/...`. The file name should be the system the component is a part of. For example we have `StoreItem` in `frontend/src/components/layout/store.tsx`.
